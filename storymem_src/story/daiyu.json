        "Early spring courtyard outside the Jia residence gate. Lin Daiyu, a slender teenage girl in pale green hanfu with a light cloak, steps down from a sedan chair, holding a silk handkerchief. She glances up, eyes clear and slightly wistful, as a maid lifts the bamboo curtain. Soft morning light, faint mist. Wide establishing shot, gentle dolly-in.",
        "Daiyu pauses by a stone path lined with budding plum branches. She adjusts her cloak and draws a small breath, a calm, poised expression. Two maids follow at a respectful distance carrying a book bundle. Quiet, elegant mood with muted colors. Medium shot, slow left-to-right pan following her walk.",
        "At the carved wooden threshold, a house steward bows. Daiyu inclines her head with a subtle smile, handkerchief lightly held. Interior lanterns glow warm against the cool outdoor tones. Close-up on her face and hands, shallow depth of field, no cut from previous movement for a seamless entrance."

        "Inside a corridor opening to the Grand View Garden: winding corridor beams, rockery, and a small pond with koi. Daiyu stands at the railing, looking at reflections on ripples, her sleeve brushing the carved wood. The mood is lyrical and quiet. Wide shot with slow tilt down to the water.",
        "She kneels briefly to straighten a sprig fallen on the stone step, her fingers delicate, expression soft with thought. The maid offers her a simple fan; she accepts with a nod. Medium close-up, steady camera, soft breeze stirring her hair ribbons.",
        "A gust shakes early peach blossoms; petals drift around her as she lifts her gaze. She lightly opens the fan, eyes bright then pensive. Close-up with petals crossing frame, gentle rack focus from petals to her eyes."

        "By a pavilion near a stream, Jia Baoyu approaches—youthful, refined, wearing light blue robe with a jade pendant. He slows and offers a courteous bow; Daiyu returns a measured nod. Light filters through latticework, creating patterned shadows. Two-shot, medium wide, static.",
        "They sit across a low stone table with tea. Baoyu speaks softly, curious; Daiyu listens, then answers with a faint smile, gaze steady yet reserved. Steam curls from porcelain cups. Medium shot alternating gentle over-the-shoulder angles, smooth match cut implied.",
        "A quiet shared laugh as a petal lands on Baoyu’s sleeve; he brushes it away, and Daiyu’s eyes follow the falling petal to the stream. The atmosphere is warm and restrained. Medium close-up on their hands and the jade catching light; subtle push-in."

        "She copies a couplet with a brush on small rice paper, pauses, and gently gathers a few fallen petals into her handkerchief. Expression tender yet distant. Medium close-up on brush, ink, and her calm profile; ambient rustle of leaves implied.",
        "She ties the handkerchief corner, stands, and looks back at the garden with a slight wistful smile. A breeze lifts her sleeve; petals drift past as the light softens. Medium shot, slow fade-out to suggest evening’s approach, ending on quiet grace."
