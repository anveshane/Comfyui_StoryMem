        "Inside a dimly lit attic room in Paris, Van Gogh, a man with unkempt reddish-blond hair and a thin beard, sits by a wooden table surrounded by paint tubes and brushes. He stares at a blank canvas, deep in thought, sunlight filtering softly through a small window. Warm yet melancholic atmosphere. Medium shot, gentle camera pan around the room.",
        "Close-up of Van Gogh dipping his brush into yellow paint and beginning to sketch bold strokes on the canvas. His eyes focus intensely, hands moving with deliberate care. The background fades softly, drawing attention to his concentration. Close-up shot with shallow focus.",
        "Van Gogh pauses, steps back, and observes his painting with mixed feelings — both hope and doubt. The candle flickers beside him, casting moving shadows on the walls. Medium shot, slow zoom-out as he exhales deeply in reflection."

        "Under the bright Provençal sun, Van Gogh walks through golden wheat fields with his easel and canvas on his back. He wears a straw hat and simple light-blue shirt, the wind gently moving the crops. Wide shot with slow tracking from behind, evoking calm and openness.",
        "He sets up his easel beside a blooming field of sunflowers. With passionate strokes, he begins painting, the sunlight glinting off his palette. Medium shot showing both the real flowers and his painted ones in the same frame.",
        "Close-up of the paintbrush gliding across the canvas — thick layers of vivid yellow and orange forming the petals. A breeze moves the real sunflowers in sync with his brushstrokes. Macro-style close-up with gentle handheld movement.",
        "Van Gogh smiles faintly, eyes glistening as he steps back to admire his work. The camera circles slowly, revealing the vast blue sky and the glowing field around him. Wide panoramic shot with a warm, uplifting feeling."

        "Macro brush pass laying thick yellow-orange petals; tiny ridges of paint shine; beyond the edge, real sunflowers sway in the same rhythm.",
        "He steps back with a faint, glistening-eyed smile; the blue vault of sky and glowing field widen around him; gentle warmth lifting the scene."
